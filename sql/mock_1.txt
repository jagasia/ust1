Problem #2:
Write a query to show the branch name,branch city where we have the maximum customers.

Problem#3:

Write a query to show the balance amount  for account number A00001. 
Note: Balance amount includes account opening balance also.

For example A00015 is having an opening balance of 1000. A00015 has deposited 2000 on 2012-06-12 and deposited 3000 on 2012-07-13. The same account has drawn money of 500 on 2012-08-12 , 500 on 2012-09-15, 1000 on 2012-12-17. So balance amount is 4000 i.e (1000 (opening balance)+2000+3000 ) â€“ (500+500+1000).







+---------+
| BALANCE |
+---------+
|   -2000 |

Problem # 4:
Write a query to display all those account number, deposit, withdrawal where withdrawal is more then deposit amount. 

For example A00011 deposited 2000 rupees on 2012-12-01 and 3000 rupees on 2012-12-02. The same account i.e A00011 withdrawn 3000 rupees on 2013-01-01 and 7000 rupees on 2013-01-03. So the total deposited amount is 5000 and total withdrawal amount is 10000. So withdrawal amount is more then deposited for account number A00011.

+----------+---------+------------+
| acnumber | DEPOSIT | WITHDRAWAL |
+----------+---------+------------+
| A00001   |    9000 |      12000 |
| A00002   |    5000 |       7000 |
+----------+---------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

				C00012 Took a loan of 500000 from bank branch with id B00010. 
				So total loan amount for customer C00012 is 600000. 

				C00013 took a loan of 100000 from bank branch B00009 and 200000 from bank branch B00011.
