Outer query	(or)	Main
Inner query	(or)	Sub query

Usually, sub query gets executed first.
the result of sub query is supplied to the Main query.


In case of correlated sub query, the sub query depends on the outer query for its execution

Whenever you see a correlated sub query, look for EXISTS or NOT EXISTS operator


EXISTS compare with INNER JOIN

select custid
from customer c
where EXISTS
(SELECT * FROM LOAN WHERE custid=c.custid);

SELECT distinct c.custid
FROM customer c
INNER JOIN loan l
ON c.custid=l.custid;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


NOT EXISTS compare with OUTER JOIN WITH CONDITION IS NULL
select custid 
from customer c
where NOT EXISTS
(SELECT * FROM LOAN WHERE custid=c.custid);

SELECT distinct c.custid
FROM customer c
LEFT OUTER JOIN loan l
ON c.custid=l.custid
where l.custid is null;
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Display all details of the customers who took loan from bid other than B00001

select * from customer where custid
in
(select custid from loan
where bid!='B00001')







Display all details of the customers who never took loan from bid B00001

select * from customer where custid
not in
(select custid from loan
where bid='B00001')
