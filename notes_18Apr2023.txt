Code Quality
	sometime, i told
	i) every variable declared must be initialized
	ii) every method should have only 1 return statement
	iii) do not comment java code. rather, delete it. 
	iv) comments should be explanation of the code.
	v) every method should contain return statement at the end of the method only.
	vi) for every if - else parts, { and } should be used, even if it is one line.

All these rules may not be followed and the program runs fine. 
But these guideliness ensure our code quality.

To check the code quality, a programmer can use tools that help them to learn code quality while programming itself.

Such tool is "SonarQube"

https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/downloads/

1) lets create a maven project.
2) choose the archetype as "quick start" for core java project	
	group id:	com.ust.sonar		is similar to package name	
	artifact id:	demo-1		is the project name
	
----------------------------------
Lets do our first demo in sonarqube.
we have started sonarqube and in localhost:9000 we have logged in as admin.
Lets create a java maven project quickstart archetype
and create few lines of code and test the code quality.

go to admin console in localhost:9000
Add project button:


sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=demo-11 -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 -Dsonar.login=addbe060478baf176c1fe8b434f655776303944a

in our maven project, pom.xml
i am going to add sonarqube plugin

maven build
	i) cmd prompt (or)
	ii) eclipse/sts

clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install

int x;
    	Date dt;
    	x=100;
    	if(x>20)
    		System.out.println("true");
    	else
    		System.out.println("false");
    	

---------------
Sonarqube requires
	java 11
	maven

mysql	(in software center)
	you have to install 2 things

	mysql workbench 8
	mysql server latest version	6.2.3

SonarQube 
	requires maven. Maven is available in software centre, but while creating projects, it is not able to download artifacts.
MySQL
	we have installed both mysql workbench and mysql server.
	but while starting mysql server, it is asking admin credentials.
We have sent a support request email.

RDBMS
	Relational DataBase Management System.

Dr. E.F.Codd
	computer scientist
	introduced Relational Database theory

he created 12 rules that a database must follow to be considered as Relational Database

every data must be represented in the form of row-column

relation between 2 entities is called as "Relationship"
Relation
	example for relation is Table
	any row-column format is a relation

hierarchical model
object based model
E-R model

Relational model
	we learn this model

Terms used in Relation model?
	data		
	row	-	tuple
	column	-	field	-	attribute
	null	-	is not a space / 0	it means missing information
	table
	relationship
	domain		business	(jargons used in the business)
			pin code	(zip code	5 digit)
	keys	
		primary
		foreign
		composite
		candidate
		unique

In a table, there can be several rows.
ex:
	in livesql, run this query
		select * from hr.employees;

	Notice that in every row, the column EMPLOYEE_ID	contains unique values, and also employee id is always present (it is not null).

	Primary key
		should have unique values in every row.
		shoud have a value and it cannot be null.

	if you see receipt table
		every row must have a different receipt number
		every row must have a receipt number. It cannot be null

	Primary Key	=	UNIQUE + NOT NULL

	Unique 		=	It must have unique values in every row, but it can be 					null

	Composite key	=	more than 1 column combines to be UNIQUE

Receipt_no	item_no	qty
1	102	1
1	111	1
1	89	2
1	98	1
2	102	

In above table, receipt_no and item_no	together is a primary key.
Primary key can be composite also

Foreign Key:
					ITEM	
Receipt_no	item_no	qty			item_no	item_name
1	102	1			89	pencil
1	111	1			98	sharpner
1	89	2			102	eraser
1	98	1			111	scale
2	102	1				
2	103	1		ERROR. Item no 103 is not allowed		
				Hence item_no of RECEIPT table is a foreign key that references item_no of ITEM table		





Normalization
	1st normal form:
		every cell should contain only 1 data

Super key
	all attributes that are used to uniquely identify a row

Primary key
	minimal number of attributes required to find a row uniquely.

Candiate key
	primary key is an example for candidate.
	Any column that is candidate to be a primary key is a candidate key.

Alternate key
	when you search based on primary key always, more queries are running based on a single column leads to performance issue.
	So if you use some other column that is also unique, then it is an alternative for primary key.

Lets create table

Table name:
	EMP

Columns:
	ID	INT
	FNAME	VARCHAR2(20)
	LNAME	VARCHAR2(20)
	EMAIL	VARCHAR2(20)

CREATE TABLE EMP
(
	ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
	FNAME VARCHAR2(20),
	LNAME VARCHAR2(20),
	EMAIL VARCHAR2(20)
);


Task:
We need to identify the datatypes of Oracle SQL.
char vs varchar2

what is varchar2
	variable length char data type.
	if we use "char" data type?		CHAR(20)
		then it will always occupy 20 char memory even if we give 1 character.
	if we use "varchar2" data type?		VARCHAR2(20)
		then it will occupy only the number of characters memory we use. not 			always 20

1) CREATE TABLE
2) ADD PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINT TO A COLUMN WHILE
	CREATING TABLE
	ALTERING TABLE
3) ADD PRIMARY KEY CONTRAINT TO COLUMN AT COLUMN LEVEL
	AT TABLE LEVEL
4) ADD CONSTRAINT WITH CONTRAINT NAME

Hands on:
1) We have created a table called EMP
CREATE TABLE EMP
(
	ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
	FNAME VARCHAR2(20),
	LNAME VARCHAR2(20),
	EMAIL VARCHAR2(20)
);


2) DESC EMP;
	TABLE EMPResult Set 1
Column	Null?	Type
ID	NOT NULL	NUMBER
FNAME	 - 	VARCHAR2(20)
LNAME	 - 	VARCHAR2(20)
EMAIL	 - 	VARCHAR2(20)
Download CSV


3) Lets learn to create primary key at table level.
For this, first we drop existing table.
DROP TABLE EMP;

CREATE TABLE EMP
(
	ID INT,
	FNAME VARCHAR2(20),
	LNAME VARCHAR2(20),
	EMAIL VARCHAR2(20),
	CONSTRAINT pkID1 PRIMARY KEY(ID)
);

--Table is created

4) We can create constraint even after the table is created.
To practise this, i will drop table and create the table without PRIMARY KEY.

DROP TABLE EMP;

Create table without primary key. (Later we will add using ALTER statement)

CREATE TABLE EMP
(
	ID INT,
	FNAME VARCHAR2(20),
	LNAME VARCHAR2(20),
	EMAIL VARCHAR2(20)
);

INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(1, 'Ajay','C M','ajay@india.com');
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(1, 'Ajay','C M','ajay@india.com');
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(1, 'Ajay','C M','ajay@india.com');

select * from emp;

ID	FNAME	LNAME	EMAIL
1	Ajay	C M	ajay@india.com
1	Ajay	C M	ajay@india.com
1	Ajay	C M	ajay@india.com


Duplicate IDs are allowed because, we have not added primary key constraint to ID column.

ALTER TABLE EMP ADD CONSTRAINT pkID2 PRIMARY KEY(ID);

We get the following error while executing above code:
ORA-02437: cannot validate (SQL_XRUNRBFICIZAFSTCVEAKIEWVN.PKID2) - primary key violated 

Reason:
	already the table contains records that violate the primary key constraint.

Solution:
	remove the duplicate records.

DELETE FROM EMP WHERE ID=1;

Now, add PRIMARY KEY constraint

ALTER TABLE EMP ADD CONSTRAINT pkID2 PRIMARY KEY(ID);
table is altered.

----------------------------------------------End of Create Table with Primary key----------------
Task:
	Identify the data types of Oracle SQL

varchar2
nvarchar2
number		NUMBER(5,2)
boolean
long
raw
long raw
binary float
int		
float
char
nchar
tinyint
date
datetime
timestamp
timestamp with timezone
timestamp with local timezone
interval year to month
interval hour to minute
blob
clob
bfile

CHAR vs	NCHAR

Lets see example:

CREATE TABLE MUNISH
(
    COL1 NCHAR(5)
);

INSERT INTO MUNISH VALUES ('ABCDE');	--row added
INSERT INTO MUNISH VALUES ('ABCDEF');
		ORA-12899: value too large for column "SQL_XRUNRBFICIZAFSTCVEAKIEWVN"."MUNISH"."COL1" (actual: 6, maximum: 5) ORA-06512: at "SYS.DBMS_SQL", line 1721


we understand that NCHAR(5) allows only 5 characters to be stored.

	
now:
CREATE TABLE MUNISH
(
    COL1 CHAR(5)
);

table created.

INSERT INTO MUNISH VALUES('◙♂♀♪☼');	--No. we are not able to add 5 characters.

ORA-12899: value too large for column "SQL_XRUNRBFICIZAFSTCVEAKIEWVN"."MUNISH"."COL1" (actual: 15, maximum: 5) ORA-06512: at "SYS.DBMS_SQL", line 1721

ALTER TABLE MUNISH ADD  COL2 CHAR(5);


CHAR(5) does not guarantee that we can add 5 characters.
	

varchar2	vs	long	vs	clob
varchar2	means we specify the size
long	means	upto 2gb
clob	means 	upto 4 gb

	all these 3 are character data types


Now, look at date types:
date
datetime
timestamp
timestamp with timezone
timestamp with local timezone
interval year to month
interval hour to minute

Large objects in oracle
blob		BINARY
clob		CHARACTERS
bfile		external large object		stores as a file in directory and a pointer

Large objects in mysql:
tinyblob		1 byte
blob		64 KB
mediumblob	16 MB
longblob		4 GB

if you want to store image/ audio/ video etc, in a table, as a data, then that column should be large object.

SQL
	DDL	Data Definition Language
	DML	Data Manipulation Language
	DCL	Data Control Language
	TCL	Transaction Control Language
	DQL	Data Query Language


DDL
	CREATE, ALTER DROP

These commands not only limited to TABLES.
There are lot of objects in database, including Tables.

CREATE TABLE	***
ALTER TABLE
	after creating a table, we can alter the table for 
		adding a column	
		modifying a column
		removing a column


TABLE EMPResult Set 10
Column	Null?	Type
ID	NOT NULL	NUMBER
FNAME	 - 	VARCHAR2(20)
LNAME	 - 	VARCHAR2(20)
EMAIL	 - 	VARCHAR2(20)


Tell me, which column can be added to this table?
	PHONE	VARCHAR(15)

ALTER TABLE EMP ADD PHONE VARCHAR2(15);
Table altered.
DESC EMP;


ALTER TABLE statement can be used to modify the column data type also
can we change the PHONE column data type to NUMBER (15,0)


ALTER TABLE EMP MODIFY PHONE NUMBER(15,0);
Table altered.
DESC EMP;

Can we remove a column from the table?

ALTER TABLE EMP DROP COLUMN PHONE;
Table altered.
DESC EMP;


DROP TABLE EMP;
	sys or system admin can recover this table from recyle bin using FLASHBACK statement.

drop table emp purge;
	drop table permanently that it cannot be recovered


DDL is completed now.

TRUNCATE
	remove all records from a table. It is similar to drop and create table.
	always all records are deleted. No conditions to specify particular rows to delete.

CREATE
ALTER
DROP
TRUNCATE
	How TRUNCATE is DDL?
	It is only removing records from the table.
	It is like DROP and CREATE.		So all records are deleted fast.
Reminder:
	after learning DELETE, we compare TRUNCATE
---------------------

DML
	INSERT
	UPDATE
	DELETE

INSERT
	adds row(s) to the table

UPDATE
	updates the existing row(s) of the table

DELETE
	deletes the records (rows) from the table

Notice that DML is going to affect the data present inside the table. It is not going to alter the structure at all.

INSERT:
	Lot of syntax is there for insert statement

syntax1:
	INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(1, 'Ram', 'Kumar', 'ram@india.com'); --added
note:
	we have to provide all the values for all columns, that too in correct order.

syntax2:
	INSERT INTO EMP (FNAME, LNAME, ID, EMAIL) VALUES ('Ajay','C M',2,'ajay@india.com'); 	--added

	INSERT INTO EMP (FNAME, ID) VALUES ('Rajesh', 3);	--added
note:
	we can specify the order of columns and provide values in that order.
	Not all columns need to be specified / provided.	But all NOT NULL columns must be present

Reminder:
There are many other insert statements like
INSERT ALL
INSERT SELECT
---------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE
Look at the rows in the EMP table:

Result Set 2
ID	FNAME	LNAME	EMAIL
1	Ram	Kumar	ram@india.com
2	Ajay	C M	ajay@india.com
3	Rajesh	 - 	 - 

Rajesh does not have email id. So we need to update that.

UPDATE EMP SET EMAIL='rajesh@india.com' WHERE ID=3;		--1 row updated

SELECT * FROM EMP;

Result Set 3
ID	FNAME	LNAME	EMAIL
1	Ram	Kumar	ram@india.com
2	Ajay	C M	ajay@india.com
3	Rajesh	 - 	rajesh@india.com

Reminder:
Different ways of UPDATE

------------------------
DELETE

We want to delete Rajesh
DELETE FROM EMP;	--Oh No! without a condition? 	all rows will be deleted.

DELETE FROM EMP WHERE ID=3;

Activity:
Practise DML statements
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
